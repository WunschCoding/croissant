      The kipferl, an Austrian crescent-shaped pastry, can be dated back to at
      least the 13th century in Austria, and came in various shapes. The kipferl
      can be made plain or with nuts or other fillings (some consider the
      rugelach a form of kipferl). The original Boulangerie Viennoise in 1909
      (when it was owned by Philibert Jacquet). The bakery proper is at left and
      its tea salon at right. In either 1838 or 1839, an Austrian artillery
      officer, August Zang, founded a Viennese bakery ("Boulangerie Viennoise")
      at 92, rue de Richelieu in Paris.

      This bakery, which served Viennese specialties including the kipferl and
      the Vienna loaf, quickly became popular and inspired French imitators (and
      the concept, if not the term, of viennoiserie). The French version of the
      kipferl was named for its crescent (croissant) shape and has become a
      universally identifiable shape across the world. The earliest known recipe
      for the present-day croissant appears in 1905, although the name croissant
      appears among the "fantasy or luxury breads" in 1853. Earlier recipes for
      non-laminated croissants can be found in the 19th century and at least one
      reference to croissants as an established French bread appeared as early
      as 1850. Zang himself returned to Austria in 1848 to become a press
      magnate, but the bakery remained popular for some time afterwards, and was
      mentioned in several works of the time: "This same M. Zank ...founded
      around 1830, in Paris, the famous Boulangerie viennoise". Several sources
      praise this bakery's products: "Paris is of exquisite delicacy; and, in
      particular, the succulent products of the Boulangerie Viennoise"; "which
      seemed to us as fine as if it came from the Viennese bakery on the rue de
      Richelieu". By 1869, the croissant was well established enough to be
      mentioned as a breakfast staple, and in 1872, Charles Dickens wrote (in
      his periodical All the Year Round) of "the workman's pain de ménage and
      the soldier's pain de munition, to the dainty croissant on the boudoir
      table". The viennoiserie technique that now characterizes the croissant
      was already mentioned in the late 17th century, when La Varenne's Le
      Cuisinier françois gave a recipe for it in the 1680 – and possibly earlier
      – edition. It was typically used not on its own but for shells holding
      other ingredients (as in a vol-au-vent). It does not appear to be
      mentioned in relation to the croissant until the 20th century. The first
      recipe corresponding to the modern croissant, not only for the shape but
      also the texture of the dough and the taste, was published in 1906, in
      Paris, in Colombié's Nouvelle Encyclopédie culinaire.[20] Sylvain Claudius
      Goy was a French chef who is sometimes said to have recorded the earliest
      recipe of the modern croissant. His 1915 book La Cuisine Anglo-Americaine
      contains a croissant recipe which Frey Fine Books consider to be the first
      such recipe published, and they describe the recipe as having "[given]
      birth to the croissant of present day". Goy's recipe uses a laminated
      yeast dough known in French as pâte feuilletée levée.
