      <h3>What is it:</h3>
      <p>
        A croissant is a French Viennoiserie in a crescent shape made from a
        laminated yeast dough that sits between a bread and a puff pastry. It is
        a buttery, flaky, Viennoiserie inspired by the shape of the Austrian
        kipferl, but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants
        are named for their historical crescent shape. The dough is layered with
        butter, rolled and folded several times in succession, then rolled into
        a thin sheet, in a technique called laminating. The process results in a
        layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry. Crescent-shaped breads
        have been made since the Renaissance, and crescent-shaped cakes possibly
        since antiquity. The modern croissant was developed in the early 20th
        century, when French bakers replaced the brioche dough of the kipferl
        with a yeast-leavened laminated dough. In the late 1970s, the
        development of factory-made, frozen, preformed but unbaked dough made
        them into a fast food that could be freshly baked by unskilled labor.
        The croissant bakery, notably the La Croissanterie chain, was a French
        response to American-style fast food, and as of 2008, 30–40% of the
        croissants sold in French bakeries and patisseries were baked from
        frozen dough. Croissants are a common part of a continental breakfast in
        many European countries.
